== TODO:

=== Ronin 0.2.4:

* Use DataMapper 0.10.0.

=== Ronin 0.2.5:

* Move Ronin::RPC code into ronin-exploits.

=== Longterm:

* Move to YARD for API documentation.
* Develop a custom YARD Template for Ronin libraries.
* Look into using Ronin over Tor/i2p.
* Discuss ideas for a Web UI:
  * Configurable menu-bar / side-bar.
  * Sinatra would be a worthy candidate.
