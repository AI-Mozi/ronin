[ Design ]

	1. lib/advisory.rb:
		Add xml parsing code for loading advisory info.

	3. lib/repo/config.rb:
		Add code to handle addition/deletion of repositories.

	5. Add rake build system.
	6. Add unit tests for top level ronin code.

[ Improvements ]

	1. Make code portable (Windows friendly).
	2. Try to secure code as much as possible.
		1. Prevent directory transversal in repo/ code.
